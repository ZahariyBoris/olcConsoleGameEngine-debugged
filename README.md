WELCOME

In this repo you can use olcGameEngine by OneLoneCoder, that was debugged by me
WARNING: I do not take any credits, because this piece of code Licensed by OneLoneCoder and 
I just wanted to help other people without taking any credits for work

It was debugged at VSCode, so I'm not sure, that it will be working correctly in other IDE's

👍👍👍

P.S: Maybe I didn't mark all the changes, so feel free to mark them
